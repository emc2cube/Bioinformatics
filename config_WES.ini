# List of the targeted intervals we wanted to sequence. 
# This is necessary as only about 60-70% of all the reads will end up in exonic regions and the rest may align anywhere else in the genome.
# To restrict the output to exonic sequences, generate a file containing for example all the exons plus 50bp at each end for getting splice site information as well.
# This can be done using the UCSC Table Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start).
# Choose the hg19 assembly of the human genome and set the track to RefSeq genes and the table to refGene.
# Use BED format as output format and assign the file an appropriate name.
# By clicking on get output, several more options can be made: Choose "create one bed record per Exon plus 50bp at each end" and save the file.
# If we have it, we can also use a .bed file specific to the library preparation kit targets.
